        Reticulated Python adds optional static and runtime typechecking
        to @a[href: "https://www.python.org"]{Python}.
        It lets programmers annotate functions and classes with types,
        and it enforces these types both before and during the execution
        of the program, providing early detection of errors.
        Crucially, Reticulated does not require that all parts of a
        program be given static types, or even any of it.
        In places where typed and untyped code interact @|---|
        for example, when an untyped variable is passed into a function
        whose argument type is @tt{Int} @|---| Reticulated can
        perform runtime checks ensure that the values in variables
        always correspond to their expected types, even when this
        cannot be guaranteed statically.
      }@p{
        Reticulated Python runs on both
        @a[href: "https://docs.python.org/3"]{Python 3} and
        @a[href: "https://docs.python.org/3"]{Python 2.7},
        although the type annotation syntax is different between the two versions.
        Reticulated on Python 3 uses the syntactic annotations provided
        by Python 3 as type annotations, while Reticulated on Python 2.7
        uses decorators to specify types.
        In both cases, the absence of an annotation implies that the
        parameters or return values are dynamically typed, as in
        standard Python.
        We also provide "type functions" for creating types that
        correspond to higher-order values in Python, like functions
        and lists, and we provide the type <tt>Dyn</tt> (for dynamic) to
        allow for, for example, heterogeneous lists, which have the
        type @tt{List(Dyn)}.
      }@p{
        Reticulated Python itself is written in Python
        (specifically, the subset of Python that is syntactically
        compatible with both Python 2.7 and 3).
        Its static, compile-time component is both a "linter" or
        static analyzer, and a source-to-source translator.
        This component parses source files (using the Python
        @a[href: "https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html"]{ast} package)
        and searches for type errors, rejecting programs that have
        statically detectable errors and syntactically inserting
        runtime checks or casts at boundaries between typed and
        untyped code, where type errors may occur.

          Dynamic checking: When necessary, methods can be type checked

          errant code, similar to gradual typing.

          Metaprogramming support: DRuby includes a combined static

        Typed Racket is a sister language of

        Racket and Typed Racket programs are fully interoperable:
        any typed functions may be used freely in untyped code and
        any untyped functions may be imported to typed code by supplying
        a type annotation.
        Type soundness is enforced despite these interactions by interpreting
        types as @a[href: "https://www.eecs.northwestern.edu/~robby/pubs/papers/ho-contracts-icfp2002.pdf"]{higher-order contracts}
        and dynamically enforcing type-correct use.

        a technique for refining the type of variables based on predicates
        prior to each occurrence of the variable in the control flow graph.
